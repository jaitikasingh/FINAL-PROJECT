This code will take fragments of strings of nucleotides from one genome, likely some sort of patient or specimen, and then
compare them to the information that we have about another genome, possibly the genome of some sort of virus. In the case of the patient
DNA and virus, we would be able to determine what sort of virus the patient had been infected with, or if they are actually infected 
at all. The fragments used as a basis for comparison against the viral genome are selected in fragments 30 nucleotides long, and 
are one-by-one compared against the sample genome to look for matches.We allow for the fragment to be declared as matching for
up to 3 mismatches/differences(10% error) in the fragment being compared, which will allow for high quality matching while still 
accounting for random errors that may occur due to innaccuracy in DNA sequency.

Data structures used and why we picked them for the implementation:
Binary Search Trees: We used Binary Search Trees in order to search through the array of nucleotides sequenced and see if they matched
the original file. We used binary search trees in order to do this because it created easily mappable and efficient paths in order to 
search and store data.
Arrays:   We used char Arrays in several instances in order to store the fragments that we were looking at individual slots, so that we would
more easily be able to compare the nucleotides one at a time. 
Vector:  We used vectors in order to store the writeouts from the genome that we were testing. Vectors are ideal in this case, because 
they allow for variability in the size of the genomes, which is necessary, as it would require unnecessary work to go through and count 
the number of nucleotides per genome being read, and re-hard code that number in for the size of the array which we would store these
nucleotide sequences in each time we wanted to compare one genome against another.

Instruction on how to use the code and test case

To use the code, you'll need a file named " 6.reads.txt." that holds the genome that holds the sequences which you would like to compare
other genomic data against. Then you'll need a text file called "my_genome" which is the other genomic data. Upload both of these two 
files so that the program may read them in, and it should read through and tell you what portions match!

Test Case: We took a set of identical sequences and compared them against each other, which should have cause the program to have
written out to the console and the file "MyResults.txt" the content of these two files. If not, then we knew that there was
an issue with how the code was being written out, or with how the tree was being set up and stepped through or with how it qualified
and dealt with mismatches. Additionally, we would place statements to write out to the console randomly throughout the code once we found
that there was an issue. This was done so as to determine where the error was occuring and to give us a better idea of what the error was.
