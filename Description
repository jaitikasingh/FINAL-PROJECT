SIDE NOTE: I just saw that we have other requirements for the seven points in our code besides like, that it runs... 
And I mean she like, edited our stuff and everything, but I'm just the world's biggest worry wart, so if you could copy and 
paste in the updated code to just go over it one more time, that would make me a very happy lady.


3pts: efficiency. Is your code neat and efficient? This means both in terms of memory usage as
well as run-time. Do you have nine loops when you only need one, etc.?
• 1pt: design. Does your code take advantage of the benefits of object oriented programming?
Does it promote code reuse? Are problems properly partitioned into sub-problems? For some
projects this will be much more important than for others. Here the key challenge is design. Is
the program designed well?


1.
This code will take fragments of strings of nucleotides from one genome, likely some sort of patient or specimen, and then
compare them to the information that we have about another genome, possibly the genome of some sort of virus. In the case of the patient
DNA and virus, we would be able to determine what sort of virus the patient had been infected with, or if they are actually infected 
at all. The fragments used as a basis for comparison against the viral genome are selected in fragments 30 nucleotides long, and 
are one-by-one compared against the sample genome to look for matches.We allow for the fragment to be declared as matching for
up to 3 mismatches/differences(10% error) in the fragment being compared, which will allow for high quality matching while still 
accounting for random errors that may occur due to innaccuracy in DNA sequency.

2.
Data structures used and why we picked them for the implementation:
*******Trees--What type of tree are we using? Binary?
Arrays:   We used char Arrays in several instances in order to store the fragments that we were looking at individual slots, so that we would
more easily be able to compare the nucleotides one at a time. 
Vector:  We used vectors in order to store the writeouts from the genome that we were testing. Vectors are ideal in this case, because 
they allow for variability in the size of the genomes, which is necessary, as it would require unnecessary work to go through and count 
the number of nucleotides per genome being read, and re-hard code that number in for the size of the array which we would store these
nucleotide sequences in each time we wanted to compare one genome against another.

Instruction on how to use the code and test case

**To use the code, you'll need a file named " 6.reads.txt." that holds the genome that holds the sequences which you would like to compare
other genomic data against. Then you'll need a text file called "my_genome" which is the other genomic data. Upload both of these two 
files so that the program may read them in, and it should read through and tell you what portions match!** REVIEW

Test Case: We took a set of identical sequences and compared them against each other, which should have cause the program to have
written out to the console and the file "MyResults.txt" the content of these two files. If not, then we knew that there was
an issue with how the code was being written out, or with how the tree was being set up and stepped through or with how it qualified
and dealt with mismatches. Additionally, we would place statements to write out to the console randomly throughout the code once we found
that there was an issue. This was done so as to determine where the error was occuring and to give us a better idea of what the error was.

Who did what
So I think I might just randomly divvy up the tasks, not based on like what we actually did, becuase we kind of just worked together to 
solve the problems, but just so that we have something clear to turn in lol
Feel free to add/subtract/whatever for the different tasks completed

Ally:
Typed up description and documentation
Testing

Jaitika:
Code creation and alteration
